### Stroke Prediction

**Objective:** The goal of this project is to apply deep learning concepts to predict whether a person will experience a stroke. By the end of this project, we will have developed a solution using a neural network, along with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), to address class imbalance and improve prediction accuracy.
**Dataset Explanation:** We will be using the stroke dataset. Its features are:


* **id:** unique identifier
* **gender:** "Male", "Female" or "Other"
* **age:** age of the patient
* **hypertension:** 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
* **heart_disease:** 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
* **ever_married:** "No" or "Yes"
* **work_type:** "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
* **Residence_type:** "Rural" or "Urban"
* **avg_glucose_level:** average glucose level in blood
* **bmi:** body mass index
* **smoking_status:** "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
* **stroke:** 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
